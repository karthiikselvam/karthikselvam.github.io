# Monologue between ME and my MIND
--- 

I Love RUNNING. There is something to it, the freedom , the thoughts and pain all at once. But lately I have hit a plateau. Running 5k, 10k is easy money for me. But things get challenging after 15k and 20k. I just wanted to get comfortable running 15k and 20k. On 19th September I just had this thought that I want to run 20k. I am going to do it. That's it period. I am running 20k tomorrow 20th September.

Following is the conversation between ME and my MIND before, during, after the RUN.

**MIND** : I didn't sleep the whole night for various reasons mostly because I was not sleepy. I don't know whether you could run 20k or not can we make 10k or 15k ? Will do 20k for another day.

**ME** : No Bitch. I aka ME the Boss has decided to run 20k just do the Job.

**MIND** : Let's see how it goes.

**ME** : I got ready and went to the ground. The weather was awesome. It was a foggy day. Let go ! I started running the first 5k easy. No resistance.

**MIND** : Yo, great man 5k in 22 minutes ? Are you crazy you need to run slowly because you have to run 20k.

**ME** : Stop Bitch. I am not going to slow down. I keep running.

**MIND** : Do you feel the pain ? Your shins are hurting.

**ME** : Yes I feel the pain so what ? I am not stopping bruh. I adjust my posture, lean forward and land smoothly for less impact. 8k done.

**MIND** : It starts to Pain again, let's take it slow.

**ME** : It's not Pain its Resistance. The devil inside me. I always wanted to fight this fucker. Let's go, it's me or you. 10k done.

**MIND** : The resistance keeps increasing - slow down or stop it.

**ME** : Haha fuck you. I am going to turn you off now. I didn't have any audiobooks. I started listening to Starboy and tried to get into a flow state. I literally forgot my MIND, the pain and the surrounding. I like this state so much I wish I would be in this state all day. All the work I do will be effortless. It was smooth for the next 30 minutes. 15km done.

**MIND** : Wakes up again. Man I can't hear anything more my whole body is numb. It's drizzling, let's do it another day. Please stop

**ME** : No brother. I promised myself I am going to do this. I keep my word. So shut the fuck up and run. 17k done.

**MIND** : Calf muscles start to hurt. Resistance Increases exponentially. Gave all the valid reasons to stop like you're going to injure your shins. You will not be able to walk tomorrow blah blah etc.

**ME** : True agreed. I can feel the pain in my calf muscles and shins. But who cares ? takes a deep breath and starts running slowly. 18k done.

**MIND** : Great Boss you are doing what you said. I will help you.

**ME** : Happy ! My greatest asset my MIND joins the party. No one is stopping me. Let's finish this shit. 20k done.

**I DID IT. Yeah.**

Finally, 20k done. I stop my music. I slow down a bit after some meters I literally stop. Observe what is happening In my body. I can feel some sort of waves running through my body down to top. I start to walk slowly while observing every part of my part. Feels like meditation. I like the pain.
To be honest it was paining a lot especially 16k to 20k. I had no sense of my legs at all. I just overpowered it. My Mind gave me all the valid reasons to stop it in the middle. But the sense of satisfaction you get after completing the task and fighting against all the demons inside you is Just amazing.
Remind yourself I control my Body and Mind. Every time I run or whatever I do for that matter. I can see there is a subtle difference between Body, Mind and I. Literally I can control my Body and MIND through sheer will power.

I wanted to make one last note..

If you have a physically healthy body and if your Mind joins hands with you (I) there is nothing stopping you. It's easy it's not work anymore. It just **FLOWS**.

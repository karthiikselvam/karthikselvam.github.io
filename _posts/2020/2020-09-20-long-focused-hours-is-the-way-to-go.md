I have always been amazed by people who can concentrate for extended periods of time on one thing.

In fact Vivekananda  in one of his [works](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_6/Lectures_and_Discourses/Concentration_and_Breathing) quotes,

"The main difference between men and the animals is the difference in their power of concentration. All success in any line of work is the result of this.High achievements in art, music, etc., are the results of concentration. The difference in  their  power of concentration also  constitutes the difference between man and man. Compare the lowest with the highest man. The difference is in the degree of concentration. This is the only difference."

I  have been having hard time concentrating my monkey mind during my learning sessions which finds itself often falling down the rabbit hole.

So before starting any learning session I follow this simple process to concentrate my mind.

Here are the steps.

1.How much time are you willing  to  spend.?

2.Divide the learning time into sessions take breaks in between if necessary. But having longer sessions is  advisable.

3.What should be the ideal outcome.

4.Use [white noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yybz_FmXdU) to forget about the surrounding environment.

5.Have a water bottle next to you because mind gives you silly reasons to walk away from task at hand.

6.Set the timer. Start Now.

7.Process:
 * Now start your training aka Learning each time your mind wanders away bring it back focus on the topic at hand.

 * Have a scratch pad: write down all the random thoughts / google searches that arises while you study.


8.Finally after the session ends check  whether  the outcome  was achieved  ? if not ask yourself Why ? Note the answer. if this answers keeps repeating you need to fix this.

Don't be hard on yourself first 10 to 20 sessions  are going to be  very tough like many things in life its uncomfortable at first but you will get used it think of this as a training session for your mind just focus on one thing train regularly consistency is the key.

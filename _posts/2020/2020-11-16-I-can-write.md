I never knew putting words on a white paper would be such a difficult task. But for sure I know it now. As I sit to write everyday I realize how challenging it is to arrange these words in a way that makes some sense.


### **The Challenge**


I know the piece I want to write it’s in my head. But I have hard time translating it into words. I realize there is some friction. Lately my only goal in writing has been not to write but to reduce friction so that words come out more fluidly.

### **The 5 step Process** 


The following are the steps that I follow to reduce the friction and enhance my writing capabilities.

1. I just open the blank paper and write the title of the topic I want to write about.  

2. I listen to White Noise to forget about my surrounding environment.  

3. I close my eyes and think about the topic.  

4. My mind keeps wondering away from the topic. But I keep bringing it back again to focus on the topic to the best of my capabilities.  

5. I ask questions to myself on the topic I want to write about instead of just thinking about the topic. My mind gives answer and I just note them down.

Every great writer I’ve ever known has faced some form of friction which they embraced and eventually they overcame it. Here I have identified my pain points now have designed an effective process to overcome them. Now its time to reduce friction. Just trust the process.

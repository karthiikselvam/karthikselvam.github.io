These are things I want to learn how to do or try out. Not for work or anything. Mostly to procrastinate on work. Like everything on this website. And this website itself.

## What I'm working on ? 

## Artifical Intelligience
- Preparing for Interviews and Giving Interviews - Currently I am Jobless.
- Lots of Coding - AI , Algo & DS.
- [Deep Learning course by Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/CS7015.html) - This course on DL is just awesome. This time i am planning to take Handwritten notes instead of taking notes in Notion.
- [Data Strcutures and Algorithms by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) - Algorithms and DS is a Showstopper for me currently. I need to work on this , consistent efforts should yeild the result.

## FINANCE & TRADING
- YTC Price Action Trader - Rereading this book again. Everytime I read this book , I gain new insights. 

## MUSIC
- Learn and Master Guitar by Steve Krenz - This course is quite rigourous but it is worth it. I have significantly improved my Staff reading speed and Timing. Still a long way to go.

## HEALTH
- Fasting 24 hours once per week.
- Mostly Running - Weightlifting - HIIT - Taekwondo and Boxing.

## Day In my LIFE
- 30 mins of Workout.
- 10 mins of Guitar.
- 10 mins of Trading.
- 10 mins of Coding.
- 5 to 6 Hours of Artifical Intelligience.

Usually it starts with 10 mins eventually it leads to 20 to 30 mins and it adds up daily. Trust Me.

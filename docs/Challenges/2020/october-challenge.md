## Challenge Review

### Artificial Intelligence : 

* I didn't work on AI.
* Most of my work hours was spent on Alogrithms and Datastructures

### Health :

* I stuck to the plan. I am very Happy
* Fasting weekly once - I missed couple of weeks.

### Finance :

* I did look for signals but still I need to be consistent.   

### Music :

* I can move around the shapes without hesistation. 
* I need to memorise root notes.
